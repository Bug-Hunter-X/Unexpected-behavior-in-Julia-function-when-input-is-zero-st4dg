This repository contains a Julia function that exhibits unexpected behavior when the input is zero. The function is intended to square positive numbers and negate negative numbers.  However, its behavior for zero is undefined. This example highlights the importance of handling edge cases explicitly in Julia functions to avoid unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version of the function that explicitly handles the case of x == 0.
